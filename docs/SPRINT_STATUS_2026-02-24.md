# SEFA Mobile App — Sprint Status (Updated: 2026-02-24)

## Summary
Mobile app has solid auth and backend connectivity.
Feature sprints are partially implemented; key product screens/flows still need completion.

## Sprint-by-sprint status

| Sprint | Scope | Status | Evidence (files/docs) | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sprint 1 | App setup + auth flow | ✅ Implemented | `docs/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | Minor UX polish |
| Sprint 2 | Backend integration layer | ✅ Implemented | `backend-connection-check.md` | Error handling standardization |
| Sprint 3 | Dashboard UI + data display | ⚠️ Partial | current status docs/code | Complete widgets/cards + loading/error states |
| Sprint 4 | Expenses flows | ⚠️ Partial | current status docs/code | CRUD screens + validation + filters |
| Sprint 5 | Budgets flows | ⚠️ Partial | current status docs/code | Budget create/edit/progress + alerts UI |
| Sprint 6 | Insights/notifications polish | ⚠️ Partial | current status docs/code | Insight views + push/in-app notification UX |

## Open mobile tasks
- Finish dashboard, expense, and budget screens end-to-end.
- Complete API hook/state consistency across modules.
- Improve test coverage (unit/component/e2e).
- Final app QA pass (empty states, offline/retry, device responsiveness).

## Change log
- 2026-02-24: Replaced fragmented status docs with one sprint status source.
